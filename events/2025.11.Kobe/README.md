https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Wiki_for_TPAC_2025_planning#WoT_Plugfest_during_TPAC_2025_(Hybrid)

## Expected demo participants

ECHONET, Siemens, ...

## PlugFest Room
PlugFest and breakout will take place in room R07

## What you should bring with you 

* Extension cable and multiple socket outlet
* If needed, power travel adapter
* Ethernet cable
* LAN Switch (if possible)
* If possible, WiFi extender or small WLAN router with WiFi to LAN option


## Proposed topics for PlugFests

### ECHONET Lite Web API devices
tbd
### OPC UA Companions with WoT
  * Onboarding
  * OPC UA Binding Collecting experience on Test Report for the WoT Registry: https://github.com/w3c/wot-binding-registry/issues/3
### Manageable actions based on current TD 2.0 version
tbd

### OCPP 2.x: Possibly only F2F topics
* will be mainly a "coffee" talk topic (e.g, during the coffee break)

### NGSI-LD 
* will be not a topic this time
  
### Demonstrating Interoperability via WoT in the Retail Domain
  * Participants from Connexxus: Ignite Retail, ArmorSafe
  * same topics as shown last year in Munich
  * the important difference is the TD is based on the retail use case conformance to the spec 
  * potential Toshiba will join the use case
  * More participants are wanted
    
### Demonstrating how easy it is to build application logic (mashups) with others' devices
  * Participants: Hitachi, possibly Ignite Retail and ArmorSafe
    
### Common Definitions
  * Participants: Siemens (Ege)
  * Build scripts for transforming TDs back and forth with the new common definitions feature.
