    <p>
Standardization is a key enabler for digitization. For example, an IoT is only possible through standardized data exchange between devices and systems. WoT enables the networking and collaboration of devices. With the TD, there is another building block for end-to-end data exchange and product descriptions.

ECLASS is currently working on finalizing an RDF representation of the ECLASS Standard, so that the ECLASS Standard can be used directly in the TD.
