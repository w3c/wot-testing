# Oct 2022 Testfest + Plugfest 

## Goals and Priorities
* Complete Implementation Reports for TD 1.1, Discovery, and Architecture 1.1
   - Collect final test cases
   - Determine at-risk items
   - Capture Implementation Descriptions
* WoT Profile
   - Define testing/assertion capture procedure
   - Capture implementation descriptions, including which do which profiles
   - Capture testing/assertion results
   - Draft the implementation report

## TD 1.1, Discovery, and Architecture
Final test inputs need to be captured for these deliverables in order to proceed to CR in the near future.
These have all reached CR draft status.

## Profiles
This combined testfest + plugfest should evaluate implementations of the WoT Profile specification and identify potential 
out of the box interoperability problems.
The goal is to ensure that the current draft of the WoT Profile Specification https://github.com/w3c/wot-profile is implementable
and satisfies the requirements.
A secondary goal is to identify feature coverage and at risk features for the Profile Implementation Report.

### Contribution to Profiles specification
  - Provide the TDs of Things of your implementation of the Profile specification at https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2022.09/Profiles/Producers. 
    You need to group them under your implementation name, like `intel-nodejs/TDs`. 
  - Fill in the [manual.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/events/2022.09.Online/Profile/manual.csv) for the Profile specification 
    and submit it in the Profiles directory under your implementation folder. Some of the assertions apply only for Consumers, some apply only for Producers.
  - Provide implementation description of your consumer implementation of the Profile specification at https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2022.09/Profiles/Consumers. You need to group them under your implementation name, like `intel-nodejs/TDs`. 
  - Fill in the [manual.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/events/2022.09.Online/Profile/manual.csv) for the Profile specification 
  and submit it in the Profiles directory under under your implementation folder. Some of the assertions apply only for Consumers, some apply only for Producers.

## Participation
This is a WoT IG event.  We can have contributors who are not WoT members but they have to be
invited as IG guests.  However, this is only the case if they are contributing to the Implementation report,
e.g. with an Implementation Description, targeting the CR candidate deliverables, etc.  Experimental
implementations that do not contribute to the test results should be deferred to the next *plugfest*.

### Schedule
* Monday - Setup
* Tuesday and Wednesday - Gathering test inputs and validation data; gathering implementation descriptions
* Thursday - Updates to Implementation Reports; interoperability testing, especially for Profiles
* Friday - Cleanup

### Gaps and Issues
Please create an issue for any gaps that you are working on during the Testfest, and label them with `Testfest 2022.09`:
- [Testfest 2022.09](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/labels/Testfest%202022.09)
