# Oct 2022 Testfest + Plugfest 

W3C testing requires demonstrating the implementability of a specification by more than one implementation. This implies
that all normative assertions of the specification need to be verified. 
If an assertion cannot be verified by two implementations, it is "at risk".
In this case, either the implementation(s) have to be improved, or the assertion needs to be adapted or removed.

Testing, that is, verification of assertions, does not need to be automated. 
If testing is not automatic implementers need to manually state
that an assertion is satisfied (or not) by their implementation.  In the following this is done with CSV
files.  In general, the "Status" entry for each assertion should be one of the following values:
* "null" (no information, the default),
* "pass" (assertion is satisfied), 
* "not-impl" (feature associated with the assertion is not implemented; only used for unimplemented optional features) and 
* "fail" (assertion is demonstrably false for the implementation, i.e. a mandatory feature is not implemented, or a feature is implemented in a way that contradicts the assertion).

## Goals and Priorities
* Complete Implementation Reports for TD 1.1, Discovery, and Architecture 1.1
   - Collect final test cases
   - Determine at-risk items
   - Capture Implementation Descriptions
* WoT Profile
   - Define testing/assertion capture procedure
   - Capture implementation descriptions, including which do which profiles
   - Capture testing/assertion results
   - Draft the implementation report

## TD 1.1, Discovery, and Architecture
Final test inputs need to be captured for these deliverables in order to proceed to CR in the near future.
These have all reached CR draft status.

### Contribution to TD 1.1 specification
  - Provide the TDs and TMs of your implementation of the TD 1.1 specification at https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2022.09.Online/TD. 
    You need to group them under your implementation name, like `intel-nodejs/TDs` or `intel-nodejs/TMs`. 
  - Copy and fill in the [manual.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2022.09.Online/TD/manual.csv) for the TD 1.1 specification 
    and submit it in the TD directory under your implementation. This file is needed for the manual results. 
    This file should go in the folder of your implementation.
    
### Contribution to Architecture specification
  - Copy and fill in the [template.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/events/2022.09.Online/Architecture/template.csv) for the Architecture specification assertions
    and submit it in the Architecture directory under Results. 
    This file should be named after your implementation, e.g. `intel-nodejs.csv`.
    Use the same name as used under other specifications.

### Contribution to Discovery specification
  - Instructions To Do.
  
## Profiles
This combined testfest + plugfest should evaluate implementations of the WoT Profile specification and identify potential 
out of the box interoperability problems.
The goal is to ensure that the current draft of the WoT Profile Specification https://github.com/w3c/wot-profile is implementable
and satisfies the requirements.
A secondary goal is to identify feature coverage and at risk features for the Profile Implementation Report.



### Contribution to Profiles specification
  - Provide the TDs of your implementation of the Profile specification at https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2022.09/Profiles. 
    You need to group them under your implementation name, like `intel-nodejs/TDs`. 
  - Copy and fill in the [manual.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/events/2022.09.Online/Profile/manual.csv) for the Profile specification 
    and submit it in the Profiles directory under Results. This file is needed for the manual results. 
    This file should go in the folder of your implementation.

## Participation
This is a WoT IG event.  We can have contributors who are not WoT members but they have to be
invited as IG guests.  However, this is only the case if they are contributing to the Implementation report,
e.g. with an Implementation Description, targeting the CR candidate deliverables, etc.  Experimental
implementations that do not contribute to the test results should be deferred to the next *plugfest*.

### Schedule
* Monday - Setup
* Tuesday and Wednesday - Gathering test inputs and validation data; gathering implementation descriptions
* Thursday - Updates to Implementation Reports; interoperability testing, especially for Profiles
* Friday - Cleanup

### Gaps and Issues
Please create an issue for any gaps that you are working on during the Testfest, and label them with `Testfest 2022.09`:
