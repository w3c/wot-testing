      A proxy and two devices were developed. The proxy aggregate devices connected 
      to the local network and expose their shadows to the Internet for control 
      by consumers. By blocking the local network from the Internet, 
      a secure environment can be achieved without the device being accessed 
      from the Internet. One device is a sensor and the other is an LED bulb. 
      Both are Wi-Fi accessible and feature descriptions can be obtained during the discovery process.
