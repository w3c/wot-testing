    "description": "This Resource describes how open or ajar an entity such as a window, door, blind or shutter is. The Property \"openLevel\" can be read (acting as a sensor). The \"openLevel\" can also be set (acting as an actuator). The \"openLevel\" is device dependent across the range provided. When the Property \"range\" is omitted then 0 to 100 is assumed where 0 means closed, 100 means fully open. If a \"range\" is provided then the lower bound=closed, upper bound=open. If Property \"step\" is present then it represents the increment between possible values; if not provided 1 is assumed.",
